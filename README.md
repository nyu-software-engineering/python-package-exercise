## Installation & Contribution

### 0. Prerequisites

- Python 3.15

### 1. Clone repository

Clone a copy of this repository to your local machine from GitHub and open the repository directory.

### 2. Install dependencies and set up virtual environment

After cloning this repository, run `pipenv install --dev` from the main project directory. This creates the project's virtual environment and installs everything listed in the `Pipfile`:

- `[packages]` - what the package itself needs to run. Here, that's just the package itself, installed in "_editable_" mode.
- `[dev-packages]` - tools needed only while developing the package, such as `pytest`, `coverage`, [build](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#generating-distribution-archives), and [twine](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/key_projects/#twine). The `--dev` flag installs these too.

### 3. Run the program

FunCasino could be run as a program through `pipenv run python -m funcasino`. Each game is also an importable module that can be used in any file after downloading the package.

### 4. Running tests

Simple example unit tests are included within the `tests` directory. To run these tests...

1. Activate the virtual environment, if not yet done, e.g. `pipenv shell`.
2. Install all the project's dependencies, including dev dependencies like `pytest`, into the virtual environment, e.g. `pipenv install --dev`.
3. Run the tests from the main project directory: `python3 -m pytest`.
4. Tests should never fail. Any failed tests indicate that the production code is behaving differently from the behavior the tests expect.

### 5. Build the Package

From the main project directory, run:

```bash
pipenv run python -m build
```

### Contribute

Contributions are always welcome! If there are any bugs or feature suggestions, feel free to open an issue describing it.

To contribute to issues:

1. Fork this repository and clone your fork to your local machine.
2. Follow the installation & setup instructions.
3. Make your changes by fixing an issue or adding a feature (make sure to add or update tests if necessary).
4. Run the tests: `pipenv run python -m pytest`.
5. Build the package: `pipenv run python -m build.`
6. Commit the changes, push them to the forked repository, and open a pull request explaining your changes.

## Documentation

### Blackjack

### Coin Toss

### Slots

### Craps
CLI implementation of standard Pass Line Craps for the `funcasino` package.

#### How It Works

* **Phase 1 (Come-Out Roll):** Win on 7 or 11. Lose on 2, 3, or 12 ("Craps"). Roll 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 to set the target Point.
* **Phase 2 (Point Phase):** Reroll until hitting your Point number again to win, or rolling a 7 to lose ("Seven Out").

#### Function Descriptions

* `print_dice(dice1, dice2)`: Takes two die and prints an ASCII art representation in the terminal.
* `play_craps(player)`: Main game controller function. Validates bets, runs Come-Out and Point roll loops, displays dice art, and updates the global `Player` object 

#### Example Output

```text
------ Welcome to CRAPS ------
Current Balance: $100
Enter your Pass Line bet: $25
Press Enter to roll the dice!

│    ●    │  │    ●    │
│  ●   ●  │  │      ●  │
└─────────┘  └─────────┘

Your Point is now: 8. Try to hit 8 before rolling a 7!
Press Enter to roll again...
